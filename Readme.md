# ðŸš€ Machine Learning Project: Train, Dockerize, and Deploy

Welcome to this machine learning project repository! This guide will help you set up the environment, train the model, build a Docker image, push it to Docker Hub, and deploy it on a remote server.

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+).

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Train the Model

Run the associated jupyter file for the provided data

## Step 5: Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/your-image-name:tag .
```

## Step 6: Push the Image to Docker Hub

```bash
docker push your-dockerhub-username/your-image-name:tag
```

## Step 7: Connect to Remote Instance

```bash
ssh username@remote-server-ip
```

## Step 8: Pull the Docker Image on Remote Machine

```bash
docker pull your-dockerhub-username/your-image-name:tag
```

## Step 9: Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name ml-model-container your-dockerhub-username/your-image-name:tag
```
